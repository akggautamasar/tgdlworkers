2. Obtain your Telegram channel ID or username.
3. Upload a file to your Telegram channel and get its message ID.
4. Construct the URL using the format:  https://tgdl.worksbeyondworks.workers.dev/file/CHANNEL_ID/MESSAGE_ID and open it.

Certainly! Let's improve the "Note" section. Here are the revised instructions:

## Important Note
- The bot **edits the fileâ€™s caption** on the channel. Ensure that this wonâ€™t cause any issues, or consider creating a new **private channel** for use with the bot.
- Use a **Telegram channel**, not a group.
- Your file must **not contain a forward tag**, and it must not be forwarded with a forward tag.
- The bot must have **edit rights inside the channel**.
- To use this API, your file size must be **less than 20 MB**. Wondering why? Read more about it [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getfile).
